# Some of my Data Science / Machine Learning learning projects worth showing

Eventually I'll add more here. For now, there are two projects in here:

## MNIST
A "Hello World" project of machine learning.

## HoldEm
An attempt to create a No Limit Hold'em Reinforcement Learning agent. Most of the effort went into creating a reliable and fast environment to test in. Definitely a good starting point for more serious projects.
